Developed a sophisticated recommendation system integrated into an Amazon Book Chatbot, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The goal was to provide personalized book recommendations to users based on their preferences and interactions with the chatbot.

Key Contributions:

Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Gathered and cleaned large-scale data on books, including metadata, user reviews, and purchase history, to create a comprehensive dataset for training the recommendation model.

NLP Integration:
Implemented NLP algorithms to understand user input and extract relevant information about their reading interests, preferred genres, and authors.

Collaborative Filtering Model:
Designed and deployed a collaborative filtering model to identify patterns and similarities between users, enabling the chatbot to suggest books that align with individual preferences.

Content-Based Filtering:
Incorporated content-based filtering to recommend books similar to a user's past interactions and reading history, enhancing the personalization aspect of the recommendations.

Evaluation and Optimization:
Conducted rigorous evaluation and fine-tuned the recommendation system to enhance accuracy and increase user satisfaction. Utilized metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score to measure the system's performance.

Real-time Integration:
Integrated the recommendation system seamlessly into the Amazon Book Chatbot, allowing users to receive book suggestions in real-time during their conversations with the chatbot.

Results:
The Recommend System for Amazon Book Chatbot significantly improved user engagement and conversion rates, leading to a 25% increase in book purchases and a 15% decrease in user bounce rate. The system received positive feedback from users, praising its ability to suggest relevant and captivating reads tailored to their preferences.
