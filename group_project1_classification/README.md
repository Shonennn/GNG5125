# Group Assignment 1: Classification

This project is a part of the course GNG5125. The goal of this assignment is to build a classifier model using various machine learning algorithms to predict the class of a given set of data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

## Data
Choice five books have the same genres and semantically the same, download: https://www.gutenberg.org
### Children literature
    - "Peter Pan" by J. M. Barrie https://www.gutenberg.org/files/16/16-0.txt
    - "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" by Mark Twain https://www.gutenberg.org/files/74/74-0.txt
    - "The Wind in the Willows" by Kenneth Grahame https://www.gutenberg.org/files/289/289-0.txt
    - "The Secret Garden" by Frances Hodgson Burnett https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/17396/pg17396.txt
    - "Treasure Island" by Robert Louis Stevenson https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/120/pg120.txt
    
Add two novels with different themes as a control group.
### Romance fiction
    - "Pride and Prejudice" by Jane Austen https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1342/pg1342.txt
### Mystery fiction
    - "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1661/1661-0.txt

## Implementation
The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. The notebook contains the following sections:

1. Data Exploration
    - Load the data
    - Overview of the data
2. Preprocessing
    - Cleaning and preparation of the data
3. Model Building
    - Split the data into training and testing sets
    - Build classifier models using various algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines)
    - Train and evaluate the models
4. Model Evaluation
    - Comparison of the models based on accuracy and other performance metrics

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/zhouzhouce/GNG5125.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd GNG5125/group_project1_classification`
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook Group_Assignment1_Classification.ipynb`
4. Run the code cells in the notebook to see the results.
