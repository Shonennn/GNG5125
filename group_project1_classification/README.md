# Group Assignment 1: Classification

This project is a part of the course GNG5125. The goal of this assignment is to build a classifier model using various machine learning algorithms to predict the class of a given set of data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

## Data
The data used in this project is the Iris dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains 150 samples of iris plants, with 50 samples from each of three species (Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, and Iris Virginica). The features included in the data are:

- sepal length
- sepal width
- petal length
- petal width

## Implementation
The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. The notebook contains the following sections:

1. Data Exploration
    - Load the data
    - Overview of the data
2. Preprocessing
    - Cleaning and preparation of the data
3. Model Building
    - Split the data into training and testing sets
    - Build classifier models using various algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines)
    - Train and evaluate the models
4. Model Evaluation
    - Comparison of the models based on accuracy and other performance metrics

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/zhouzhouce/GNG5125.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd GNG5125/group_project1_classification`
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook Group_Assignment1_Classification.ipynb`
4. Run the code cells in the notebook to see the results.
